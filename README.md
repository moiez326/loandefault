# Loan Default Analysis

# Global Bank Loan Default Analysis

## Introduction
Global Bank (GB) stands at the confluence of deriving profit from loan interests and managing the risk of defaults. A robust loan approval process is paramount for sustaining profitability and reducing the risk associated with loan defaults. This repository presents an analytical exploration aimed at optimizing GB's loan approval mechanisms.

## Objective
The primary objective of this data analysis initiative is to uncover critical insights that can enhance GB's loan approval criteria, reduce human error, and increase the efficacy of predicting loan defaults.

## Key Questions
- What underlying factors contribute to loan defaults at GB?
- Are there distinguishable patterns or features that differentiate clients who default from those who do not?

## Analysis Overview
I conducted a series of analyses to explore various dimensions of the loan approval process:
- A deep dive into the characteristics of clients and their correlation with loan defaults.
- An examination of financial health indicators and their predictive power regarding default likelihood.
- An investigation into the specifics of the loans issued, such as amounts, purposes, and associated risks.
  
- Loan amount was not a significant indicator of clients defaulting.

- Credit-related variables such as derogatory reports showed a more drastic difference in frequency of bad and good loan status.

- The data shows that both 'Good' and 'Default' loans exhibit a broad range of debt to income ratios, predominantly between 20% and 50%, without a discernible pattern or trend line correlation, suggesting that loan default is not strongly dependent on the debt to income ratio.

## Conclusion
Findings indicate that the reasons behind taking a loan and a client's financial history are more predictive of default than just the financial metrics alone. Particularly, loans taken out for debt consolidation have a notably higher default rate compared to other purposes, such as home improvements. These insights suggest a need for Global Bank to adapt its risk assessment protocols to focus more on the purpose of the loan and the borrower's credit history.
## Future analysis
Based on this project, I recommend that GB:
- Broadens the classification criteria for job types and loan purposes, integrating a more detailed financial profile for each client.
- Incorporates additional predictive indicators like credit scores and financial behavior history into the assessment model.
