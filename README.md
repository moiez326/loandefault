# Loan default analysis
## Project Overview
A ficticious bank, Global Bank (GB) derives profit from interest on loans but faces risks when clients default on their loans (DL). Not every loan that is approved is paid off (GL), and the loan approval process is crucial to minimize defaults and maximize good loans. The bank's decision-making on loan approvals, based on various factors, is not infallible and is subject to human error. 

## Objective
- To mitigate this, GB is conducting a data analysis in order to gain insights in order to assist in the loan approval process. 
## Key Questions
- What factors or category of factors are most indicative of a client's likelihood to default? 
- Is there a statistically significant difference in certain numerica/categorical features between clients who default and those who do not?

### Data Source
Information on 5,960 home equity loans and includes various attributes such as loan amount, mortgage information, applicant demographics, and loan outcomes (default or repayment).

## Key Insights
- **Default Prediction**: We aim to 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The analysis of the dataset revealed valuable insights, such as the significance of financial metrics, correlations between loan attributes, and differences in loan default rates for various reasons and job types.

## Analysis Summary and Key Findings

- Loan amount was not a significant indicator of clients defaulting.

- Credit-related variables such as derogatory reports showed a more drastic difference in frequency of bad and good loan status.

- The data shows that both 'Good' and 'Default' loans exhibit a broad range of debt to income ratios, predominantly between 20% and 50%, without a discernible pattern or trend line correlation, suggesting that loan default is not strongly dependent on the debt to income ratio.
