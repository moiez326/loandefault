The goal is to derive insights into how discounts influence customer perceptions and to identify patterns that could inform future pricing strategies.

### Data Source:
- The analysis is based on a dataset (`cleaned_loan.csv`) containing detailed information on discounts and customer ratings, among other variables.

## Conclusions
The analysis suggests that while discounts are a common strategy, they do not significantly alter customer ratings. This could imply that product quality and brand reputation might play more substantial roles in customer satisfaction than pricing strategies alone.
